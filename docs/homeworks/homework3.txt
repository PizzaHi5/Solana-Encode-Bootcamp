Installing other wallets
Try one of the following wallets :

download the extension for the chrome / brave browser
The Phantom wallet is available as a mobile download application and a browser extension tool
for various desktop web browsers.

Phantom presents a graphical user interface (GUI) to mask the technicalities of signing
transactions and storing funds. It also has an inbuilt swap and stake functionality.
. Solflare Wallet

Try interacting with Apps on the Dev network
For example
https://devnet.zeta.markets/
they air drop you some test USDC for you to use in their app.

-   Ran through all the steps above. Already had a phantom wallet installed. Made my burner wallet. 
    Connected to solana devnet. Got my 1 SOL airdrop. This guide worked out very well for me!
