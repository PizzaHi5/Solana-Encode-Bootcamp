Homework 15
. Discuss in your teams
. Should projects spend more on security ?
-   Yes, currently a lot of hacked projects did not get audits. Audits are very helpful in avoiding
    issues forward. Some team members comment that companies purposely avoid security up front.
    Its about MVPs for getting investment. 

. What measures would you take to improve security ?
-   rekt.com seeing new hacks
-   looking at security audits thru secureum
-   practice auditing thru open-source auditing companies like code4arena 

. Should bounties be paid to attackers after the exploit ?
-   Yes, getting a bounty for finding a security hole is good in my opinion. Every situation is different
    however, generally speaking, ppL should be incentivized to find security holes and fix the problem.

. Look through the example code in the repo, can you find any potential issues ? Think particularly
about the flow of the lottery game.
