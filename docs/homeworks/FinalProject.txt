Final Project is in a separate repo:
https://github.com/PizzaHi5/PyramidLottery

With my team of 3, we looked at the concept of EigenLayer (an EVM
smart contract protocol designed to allow restaking of onchain 
assets) and applied it to a lottery system. Players can purchase
tickets for one lottery and restake those onchain ticket assets 
into another lottery! This was a fun project idea and I had a lot
of fun presenting this to the group on the final day of class!

A copy of the presentation is in docs/
