-   Saw many examples of sending more transactions than is processable on Eth or Btc per second!
    In 15seconds, I sent 135% of Eth capacity and 440% of Btc capacity. Used 0.041% of Solana capacity!

Fizz buzz program
1. Create a project called bootcamp using Cargo
2. The main function should print a welcome message.
3. Write a 'fizz buzz' function that will be called from your main function.
1. The function should have a loop counting up to 301
2. If the count is divisible by 3, print "fizz"
3. If the count is divisible by 5 print "buzz"
4. If the count is divisible by 3 and 5 print "fizz buzz"
5. At the end print the number of times "fizz buzz" occurred.
-   I called this project "hw4" in the hw/ folder. 
-   It took a lot of time for me to start to pick up on the syntax for a new language. Happily, the syntax is not too foreign for me.
    Cairo and Noir have very similar syntax since those are ZK languages using Rust-like syntax. I am starting to get the hang of using
    this style. I used a lot of <> to specify my values. Did some research to dig into using RangeInclusive<i32> for this problem. That
    way I could specify the 301 sized vector right away and iterate through that vector. I got an answer of 20! Glad I got this to work :)
    Use 'cargo run' to see the result.
