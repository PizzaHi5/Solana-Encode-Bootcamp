Homework 8 - DeFi / Token Program
General Questions (Discuss in your teams)
1. How in practice can the DEX design differ between Solana and Ethereum?
-   DEX design in Solana must account for the SeaLevel Parallel Runtime. Swapped tokens must be 
    accounted for in parallel between nodes. Each node is run in sequence. Most tokens on Solana
    are Upgradable so DEXs should account for this. 

. What features would you look for when selecting a Solana wallet?
-   The ease in keypair generation is nice. 
    1. Does any wallet have all these features ?
    -   Most wallets have NFT displays, built in DEX, account balance display, and account activity
        when using this app. 
    . Which wallet have you chosen ?
    -   I have been using Phantom for SOL

. How is the token functionality design process different on Solana?
-   Since all tokens are Upgradable by default, token immutability must be designed for in Solana.
    Eth is the opposite.

. Which Solana DeFi project has the most value locked ?
-   Checked defillama, highest TVL is Marinade.Finance. Liquid staking is the hot new things atm. 
    Highest 2 TVLs are liquid staking on SOL. 

. What difference do low fees on a blockchain make to trading strategies ?
-   Low fees = essential. Many strategies require trading frequently so high fees = not usable.
