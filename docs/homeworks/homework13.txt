1. Use the Anchor command line tools to create a new project.
. Adapt the default program as follows
1. In an account we want to store a balance of type u64
. On initialisation, this balance should be set to 100

-   I had a very difficult time getting a new anchor repo setup with 'anchor init hw13'.
    Somehow the way I modified the repo messed up how it works. I learned that changing 
    edition 2021 to rust-version 1.70.0 will not work because they do not mean the same
    thing. Changing the anchor-lang to 0.28.0 made it compile much faster however always
    compiled with an error. I am glad I got it working! 6/16/23
